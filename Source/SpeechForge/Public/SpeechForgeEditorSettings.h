 * Signing in to a speech provider — one person's business, not the project's.
 *
 * A key is per person and per machine, so it has no place on a Project Settings page whose values
 * are written to a committed ini. Nothing here is `config` either: the field is `Transient`, hands
 * its value straight to the OS credential vault and blanks itself, and what persists is the vault
 * entry, outside the project directory where it cannot be copied, committed or zipped along with it.
 *
 * The account is yours. We never resell speech.
