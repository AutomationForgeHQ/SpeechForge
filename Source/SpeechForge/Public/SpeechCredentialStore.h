 * Reads and writes provider secrets through the operating system's credential vault.

 * The requirement is that a key must not survive a project copy, a commit, or a zip sent to someone
 * else. An ignored config file does not achieve that - it still exists inside the project directory,
 * so anyone who copies the folder wholesale copies the key with it, and one mistaken ignore rule
 * publishes it. Storing outside the project removes the possibility rather than mitigating it.
 *
 * Nothing here is a UPROPERTY. Reflected properties can be serialised into config, saved into an
 * asset, or dumped by a details panel, so the secret never becomes one - callers fetch it, use it,
 * and let it go.
